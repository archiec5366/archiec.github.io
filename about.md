Forge was born on Solace, a planet in the Outlands. He was trained in martial arts and had a strong passion for sport and competition. He dreamed of one day becoming a Champion in the Apex Games, a prestigious battle royale tournament that takes place in the Outlands.

Forge worked hard and eventually earned a spot in the Games. He fought valiantly and eventually rose to the rank of Champion. His skill and determination made him a fan favorite, and he quickly became a symbol of hope in the Outlands.

However, one day he was ambushed by a group of ruthless mercenaries. They tried to kill him, but he fought back and managed to escape. He was severely injured and barely managed to make it back to his home planet.

While recovering from his injuries, Forge vowed to use his newfound strength to fight back against the mercenaries. He trained hard and eventually developed a set of fighting techniques that he called the Forge Protocol.

Using the Forge Protocol, he was able to easily defeat his foes!

Although Apex Legends is a awesome battle royale game on it's 14th season currently, Forge is a made up legend!
